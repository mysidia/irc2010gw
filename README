IIRC GW

This software is the end user 'gateway' server for improved irc.

The function of an end-user gateway on an iirc network is to accept
connections from ordinary users operating traditional IRC clients.

This is the software that will be expected to communicate with other
levels on the IRC network on behalf of an actual human beings.

The other layers are:

       o User servers  (iirc_userv)
          * Process user logins, hold user identity, certificates,
            authentication, trust, and related information on behalf
            of a user connecting
          * Talk to iirc_gw (gateway servers) and deliver messages to
            connected users

       o Channel servers (iirc_cserv)
          * Manage and control access to channels
          * Maintain records on which clients have joined a
            channel
          * Addresses channel messages to clients that are logged on
            members of the channel and have asked to receive messages
            [multi-recipient messages are used]

       o Name Mapping servers (iirc_map)
          * Allows channel names/nick names to be registered 
            across multiple user servers
          * Maintains 'global identifiers' for local nicknames and
            channels
          * Determines what nicknames and channels will be recognized
            by users of the particular mapping server
